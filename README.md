   ## Description
  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. This application is used for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

  Still experiencing issues with some of the functionality with this project.  Having issues when updating certain items within database.
